My Progress while trying to complete 100 Days Of SwiftUI Challenge by Paul Hudson - https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

> ## The Course

---

> **Days 1-12: Introduction to Swift**

The first 12 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover all the fundamentals of the Swift
programming language. You’ll watch about a selection of one-minute videos every day, and complete short quizzes about each of those videos.

- **[Day 01](../master/Day%20001)**
  – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation

- **[Day 02](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/2 "Day 02")**
  – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums

- **[Day 03](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/3 "Day 03")**
  – operators and conditions

- **[Day 04](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/4 "Day 04")**
  – loops, loops, and more loops

- **[Day 05](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/5 "Day 05")**
  – functions, parameters, and errors

  – closures part two

- **[Day 08](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/8 "Day 08")**
  – structs, properties, and methods

- **[Day 09](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/9 "Day 09")**

  – protocols, extensions, and protocol extensions

- **[Day 12](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/1 "Day 12")**
  – optionals, unwrapping, and typecasting<br/><br/>

> **Days 13-15: Consolidation I**

You just learned a lot about Swift in only 12 days, so before we continue it's important you reflect on what you've learned: look for weak spots, re-watch videos, re-take tests, and so on, until you feel comfortable that you have mastered all the Swift language fundamentals covered in days 1-12.

- **[Day 13](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/13 "Day 13")**
