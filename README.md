> **Days 1-12: Introduction to Swift**

The first 12 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover all the fundamentals of the Swift
programming language. You’ll watch about a selection of one-minute videos every day, and complete short quizzes about each of those videos.

  – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation

- **[Day 02](../master/Day%20002 "Day 02")**
  – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums

- **[Day 03](../master/Day%20003 "Day 03")**
  – operators and conditions

- **[Day 04](../master/Day%20004 "Day 04")**
  – loops, loops, and more loops

> **Days 13-15: Consolidation I**

You just learned a lot about Swift in only 12 days, so before we continue it's important you reflect on what you've learned: look for weak spots, re-watch videos, re-take tests, and so on, until you feel comfortable that you have mastered all the Swift language fundamentals covered in days 1-12.
